## Git vs GitHub

- **Git** is a version control software.
- **GitHub** is a platform used to store all developers' project source code in one place.
- On GitHub, we can create repositories to store project code.
- All developers can connect to the GitHub repository for code integration (making code integration very easy).
- GitHub allows tracking of all code changes:
  - Who modified
  - When modified
  - What was modified
  - Why modified

---

## Environment Setup

1. Create an account at [github.com](https://www.github.com) (free of cost).
2. Download & install Git client software: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Open Git Bash and configure your name and email:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "your-name"
   git config --global user.email "your-email"
   ```

> Configuring name and email is a one-time process.

## What is a GitHub Repository?

- A repository is a place to store project source code/files.
- For each project, one GitHub repository is created.
- Two types of repositories:
  1. **Public Repo**: Anybody can see & you choose who can commit.
  2. **Private Repo**: You choose who can see & who can commit.

### Example:
Project Git Repo URL: `https://github.com/ashokitschool/sbi_loans_app.git`

Project team members use the repo URL to connect.

## Git Architecture

1. Working Tree
2. Staging Area
3. Local Repository
4. Central Repository (Remote)

## Git Bash Commands

```bash
git init              # Initialize working tree
git status            # Show working tree status
git add <file-name>   # Add file to staging area
git add .             # Add all files to staging area
git commit -m "msg"   # Commit staged files to local repo
git push              # Push local commits to remote repo
git restore <file>    # Unstage or discard changes
git log               # Show commit history
git rm <file-name>    # Remove a file
git clone <repo-url>  # Download remote repo to local
git pull              # Get latest changes from remote repo
```

> Note: After `git rm`, commit and push to delete file from remote repo.

## Git GUI

- A desktop tool to perform Git operations.
- Run in working tree:

```bash
git gui
```

---

## .gitignore File

- Specifies files/folders to skip in Git operations.

### Example:
```
.settings
.classpath
.project
target/
```

---

## Git Branches

When multiple teams work on the same repo, use branches to avoid delivery issues.

### Recommended Branches:

- `main` (default)
- `develop` (development team)
- `sit` (bug fixing team)
- `research` (R&D team)
- `release` (production team)

> Multiple teams can work in parallel using branches.

---

## Lab Task

1. Go to GitHub and create `develop` branch from `main`.
2. Clone the repo (main branch will be cloned by default):
   ```bash
   git clone <url>
   ```
3. Switch to develop branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```
4. Create a file and push it to `develop` branch.
5. Create a Pull Request and merge `develop` into `main`.


# Git Interview Concepts

---

## ✅ What is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request** is used to merge changes from one branch into another.

**Example:**  
Merging changes from the `develop` branch to the `main` branch.

---

## ✅ What is Git Stash?

**Git Stash** is used to save the current changes in a backup (stash) and make the working directory clean.

### Example Scenario:

- `JIRA-101` assigned at 9 AM → Work started, partial changes done.
- At 11 AM, `JIRA-102` assigned → It's critical.
- To work on `JIRA-102`, stash the `JIRA-101` changes:
  
  ```bash
  git stash
  ```

- After pushing `JIRA-102` changes, get `JIRA-101` changes back to working tree :
  
  ```bash
  git stash apply
  ```

---

## ✅ How to Remove Git Local Commits?

Use the `git reset` command to undo local commits.

### Types of Reset:

- **Soft Reset**: Removes commit but retains changes in the staging area.
  
  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~1
  ```

- **Hard Reset**: Removes both commit and file changes.
  
  ```bash
  git reset --hard HEAD~1
  ```

---

## ✅ How to Revert Central Repo Commits?

Use the `git revert` command to undo changes from the remote repository.

```bash
git revert <commit-id>
git push
```

---

## ✅ What is Git Cherry-pick?

- By default, `git merge` merges all commits from one branch to another.
- If you want to merge only a **specific commit**, use `git cherry-pick`.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-id>
```

---

## ✅ Git Pull vs Git Fetch

| Command     | Description                                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git pull`  | Downloads changes from the remote repo and merges into working directory |
| `git fetch` | Downloads changes to the local repo only                   |

To merge after `fetch`, run:

```bash
git merge
```

> `git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge`

---

## ✅ What is Git Fork?

**Git Fork** is used to copy someone else's GitHub repository into your own GitHub account.

- Useful for contributing to open-source projects.
